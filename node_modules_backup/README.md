# Node modules backup

## Rationale

Hopefully we'll never need this, but if one day you...

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install`
3. The install fails because somewhere in the universe, someone made breaking changes to some code that we depend on.

...you'd be in trouble.

As a contingency plan, we've archived the `node_modules` directory, so you should be able to unzip that.

## Restoration instructions

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kylejlin/rand-note.git
cd rand-note
```

2. Set your Node version to the one used for in this repository.
```sh
nvm use
```

3. Unzip. Before unzipping, make sure your current working directory is the root of the repository.
```sh
tar -xzf node_modules_backup/node_modules.tar.gz
```

4. Try running it (and pray)!
```sh
npm start
```
