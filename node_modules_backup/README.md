# Node modules backup

## Rationale

Hopefully we'll never need this, but if one day you...

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install`
3. The install fails because somewhere in the universe, someone made breaking changes to some code that we depend on.

...you'd be in trouble.

As a contingency plan, we've archived the `node_modules` directory, so you should be able to unzip that.
